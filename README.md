# fishhawk-L1rocket

This repository documents my NAR Level 1 Certification Rocket.  
This project is not only a great way to get started in hobby rocketry, but it also serves as the perfection introduction to aerospace design, especially when you approach the build as a  I case study: modeling, simulating, building, equipping, and analyzing a rocket system.

---

## Objectives
- Earn L1 certification flight
- Predict flight performance using OpenRocket
- Run structural & aerodynamic analysis (FEA/CFD practice)
- Collect in-flight data (via altimeter, accelerometer, GPS)
- Compare predicted vs. actual performance and document findings
